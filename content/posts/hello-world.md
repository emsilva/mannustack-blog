I've been thinking about starting a blog for years. Finally got around to it.

Not because I think the world desperately needs another tech blog, but because I keep having conversations about software engineering, team management, and the weird intersection of technology and business that make me think "huh, maybe other people are dealing with this too."

## Why now

After 24 years of building software—first as an engineer, now managing teams at Kyndryl—I've accumulated a bunch of opinions about how this stuff works. Some of them might even be right.

The thing is, most of the engineering content I see online falls into two buckets: either basic tutorials that don't reflect the complexity of real systems, or high-level strategy pieces that are too abstract to actually implement. There's not enough content about the messy middle—how do you actually scale a team from 5 to 50 people? What do you do when your well-intentioned microservices architecture becomes a distributed monolith? How do you convince your org to pay down technical debt?

I deal with these questions daily. Figured I might as well write about them.

## What I'm thinking about

The stuff that keeps me up at night (professionally speaking):

**Building platforms that don't suck.** I work on Kyndryl Bridge, which serves a lot of users doing important things. The technical challenges are interesting, but the organizational ones are harder. How do you build something that's both flexible enough to adapt and stable enough that people trust it?

**Growing engineers without burning them out.** I manage people who manage people who write code. The best part of my job is watching someone figure out a hard problem or grow into a new role. The worst part is realizing I've accidentally created an environment where someone feels stuck or overwhelmed.

**Making smart bets on technology.** Every architectural decision is a gamble on the future. Will this framework still be maintained in three years? Is this the right level of abstraction? Are we solving today's problems or tomorrow's?

**Dealing with legacy systems.** Everything is legacy eventually. The question is whether you planned for it or not.

## What you'll find here

I'm not planning to write tutorials about specific technologies—there are better places for that. Instead, I want to dig into:

- War stories from building software at enterprise scale
- Lessons learned from managing distributed teams
- Thoughts on technical decision-making and tradeoffs
- The human side of engineering leadership
- Probably some rants about things that annoy me

I'm going to try to be honest about when things go wrong and what I've learned from screwing up. The polished success stories don't teach you much.

## Fair warning

I'm not trying to build a personal brand or optimize for engagement. I have strong opinions about some things and I'm still figuring out others. I'll probably change my mind about stuff I write here.

Also, I work for a big company, so standard disclaimer applies: these are my personal views, not my employer's.

## What's next

I've got a few posts brewing about technical debt (spoiler: it's worse than you think and better than you fear), platform thinking, and some thoughts on why so many digital transformation projects fail.

We'll see how this goes. If you find any of it useful or want to argue about it, you can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/emsilva).
