# Hey there

I'm Mannu, and I've been building software for over 24 years. Currently, I'm a Director of Engineering at Kyndryl, where I work on the Kyndryl Bridge platform and spend my days helping engineering teams figure out how to build better software.

## What I do

I lead a bunch of talented engineers and try to keep our platform from falling over while we build new features. Most of my time goes into:

- Figuring out how to scale systems that need to work for lots of people
- Helping engineers grow their careers and solve interesting problems  
- Making decisions about technology that hopefully don't come back to bite us later
- Working with teams spread across different time zones (which is as fun as it sounds)

## How I got here

I've been at IBM and then Kyndryl for most of my career. Started as an engineer, gradually took on more responsibility, and somehow ended up managing people instead of just code. Along the way, I've worked on automation projects for hundreds of clients and learned a lot about what works (and what definitely doesn't) when you're trying to modernize legacy systems.

Before my current role, I ran innovation teams across Latin America and later expanded that to 36 countries. Sounds impressive on paper, but mostly it meant a lot of video calls at weird hours and figuring out how to get teams in different cultures to work together effectively.

## What I've learned

After two decades of this, I've picked up a few things:

- **Good software comes from good teams** - You can have the best architecture in the world, but if your team is dysfunctional, you're screwed
- **Simple usually beats clever** - That brilliant abstraction you're proud of? Future you (and your teammates) will probably hate it
- **Context matters more than you think** - What works at a startup with 10 people rarely works at an enterprise with 10,000
- **Technical debt is real debt** - It compounds, and eventually someone has to pay it back

## Why this blog exists

I've made a lot of mistakes over the years and learned from most of them. I figured I might as well write some of that stuff down. Maybe it'll save someone else from repeating the same errors.

I'm not trying to sell you anything or build my personal brand. I just think there's value in sharing what I've learned from building software at scale, managing teams, and navigating the weird world of enterprise technology.

## Beyond work

When I'm not staring at code or sitting in meetings, I like to... well, I'll probably write about that stuff too if it's interesting.
